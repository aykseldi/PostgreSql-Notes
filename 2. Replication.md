# Database Replication

> This notes aims at starting a replication process on 2 database instances of PostgreSql.

## Installing / Getting started

## 1. On Primary Database

Open the postgresql.auto.conf file and insert the following lines. 
The critical point is that after making such changes in the auto.conf file, it is necessary to reload or restart the database before issuing a command like any alter system on the last SQL side.

```shell
-bash-4.2 $ vi postgresql.auto.conf
```
**wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 8
wal_keep_segments = 100
max_replication_slots = 2**

 * The following was added to the hba_conf file on Primary Database.
```shell
cat pg_hba.conf
```
```shell
#TYPE   DATABASE      USER       ADDRESS         METHOD
#"local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local all all trust
#IPv4 local connections:
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
host all all 192.168.56.101/32 trust
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
#IPv6 local connections:
host all all :: 1/128 md5
#Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
#replication privilege.
local replication all md5
host replication all 127.0.0.1/32 ident
host replication all :: 1/128 ident
**host replication all 0.0.0.0/0 trust** --- >> Add this line
```


 * Create a replication slot on primary database
  > The display can be enhanced with extended display.
   ```shell
    postgres = # \ x - >> The display can be enhanced with extended display.
  ```
 * Write the query below to create slot
  
  ```shell
 postgres = # select pg_create_physical_replication_slot ('ab2019', true);
 pg_create_physical_replication_slot
-------------------------------------
 (Ab2019,0 / 18D55850)
 (1 row)
 ```

 * Check the replication slot that you just create with sql below
 ```shell
 postgres = # select * from pg_replication_slots;
 slot_name | plugin | slot_type | datoid | database | temporary | active | active
 e_pid | xmin | catalog_xmin | restart_lsn | confirmed_flush_lsn
 ----------- + ----------- + -------- + -------- + -------- - + ----------- + -------- + ------
 ------ + ------ + ------- + -------------- + ------------- --------------
 ab2019 | | physical | | | f | f |
      | | | 0 / 18D55850 |
 (1 row)
```


## 2. On Standby Database
The command below is structured like

  * It is written ip address of primary database.
  * Directory is the standby directory.  It was written to tell where to put on standby , copy of database files that we get from      the primary.

```shell
pg_basebackup -h 192.168.43.202 -p 5432 -U postgres -D / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / data -R -S ab2019 -X stream -P -v> log 2> & 1; date;
```

After replication is succeeded, you can look at the recovery.conf file by giving the following command in standby database.

```shell
cat /var/lib/pgsql/11/data/recovery.conf

standby_mode = 'on'
primary_conninfo = 'user = postgres passfile =' '/ var / lib / pgsql / .pgpass' 'host = 192.168.43.202 port = 5432 sslmode = prefer sslcompression = 0 krbsrvname = postgres target_session_attrs = any'
primary_slot_name = 'ab2019'

```

## 3. Replication on the Same or Different Servers

  * We can do the replication process on multiple different machines. But we have to create new slots on the primary.

  ```shell
  select pg_create_physical_replication_slot ('ab2019', true);
  ```
  * Making replication on the same machine
    ```shell
    postgres = # select pg_create_physical_replication_slot ('local', true);
    pg_create_physical_replication_slot
    -------------------------------------
    (Local, 0 / 1A000060)
    (1 row)
    ```

  * We made replication by installing the abdata folder on the same machine.

    ```shell
    -bash-4.2 $ pg_basebackup -h 192.168.43.202 -p 5432 -U postgres -D / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / abdata -R -S local -X stream -P -v --tablespace-mapping = / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / temp = / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / abtemp
    
    pg_basebackup: initiating base backup, waiting for checkpoint to complete
    pg_basebackup: checkpoint completed
    pg_basebackup: write-ahead log start point: 0 / 1B000028 on timeline 1
    pg_basebackup: starting background WAL receiver
    269106/269106 kB (100%), 2/2 tablespaces
    pg_basebackup: write-ahead log end point: 0 / 1B0000F8
    pg_basebackup: waiting for background process to finish streaming ...
    pg_basebackup: base backup completed
    ```

  **Since temp tablespace was used on the same machine, we had to map temp tablespace.**


* After that, replicate database command is run from the bash

```shell
/usr/pgsql-11/bin/pg-ctl -D /var/lib/pgsql/11/abdata/ start

waiting for server to start .... 2019-02-10 19: 04: 10.567 +03 [13196] LOG: listening on IPv4 address "0.0.0.0", port 5433

 done
server started
```

* Now lets look at the processes that postgres started;

```shell
[root @ localhost ~] # ps -fe | grep postgre
postgres 11075 1 0 17:03? 00: 00: 00 / usr / pgsql-11 / bin / postmaster -D / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / data /
postgres 11077 11075 0 17:03? 00:00:00 postgres: logger
postgres 11079 11075 0 17:03? 00:00:00 postgres: checkpointer
postgres 11080 11075 0 17:03? 00:00:00 postgres: background writer
postgres 11081 11075 0 17:03? 00:00:00 postgres: walwriter
postgres 11082 11075 0 17:03? 00:00:00 postgres: autovacuum launcher

postgres 11348 11347 0 17:18 pts / 6 00:00:00 -bash
postgres 12185 11075 0 18:13? 00:00:00 postgres: walsender postgres 192.168.43.212 (45558) streaming 0 / 1C000140
postgres 13196 1 0 19:04 pts / 0 00:00:00 / usr / pgsql-11 / bin / postgres -D / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / abdata
```

## 3. Replication Configuration and Status Control 

* Check the Log files location that database creates

```shell
cd /var/lib/pgsql/11/abdata/log

-bash-4.2 $ ll
68 total
-rw -------. 1 postgres postgres 2388 Feb 10 18:51 postgresql-Sat.log
-rw -------. 1 postgres postgres 62926 Feb 10 18:51 postgresql-Sun.log
```

* All settings related to logging is in postgresql.conf file. So logging location, frequency,  etc can be changed from here.

**/abdata/postgresql.conf**

* Below query shows whether recovery is  ongoing. **False means you are on master database, true means standby  database**

```shell
postgres = # select pg_is_in_recovery ();
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 f
(1 row)
```



* Now we have replication slot. First one is looking at different machine, second one is locak. We can learn that both of them process the same transaction log. We see this by looking at restart_lsn.

```shell
\ x
postgres = # select * from pg_replication_slots;
- [RECORD 1] ------- + -----------
slot_name | ab2019
plugin |
slot_type | physical
datoid |
database |
temporary | f
active | t
active_pid | 12185
xmin |
catalog_xmin |
restart_lsn | 0 / 1C000140
confirmed_flush_lsn |
- [RECORD 2] ------- + -----------
slot_name | local
plugin |
slot_type | physical
datoid |
database |
temporary | f
active | t
active_pid | 13203
xmin |
catalog_xmin |
restart_lsn | 0 / 1C000140
confirmed_flush_lsn |
```

* What is the status of REPLICA and MASTER? To see this. How much he sent, how far behind ...
```shell
postgres = # select * from pg_stat_replication;
- [RECORD 1] ---- + ------------------------------
pid | 12185
usesysid | 10
usename | postgreS
application_name | walreceiv is

client_hostname |
client_port | 45 558
backend_start | 2019-02-10 18: 13: 28.23588 + 03
backend_xmin |
state | streaming
sent_lsn | 0 / 1C000140
write_lsn | 0 / 1C000140
flush_lsn | 0 / 1C000140
replay_lsn | 0 / 1C000140
write_lag |
flush_lag |
replay_lag |
sync_priority | 0
sync_state | async
- [RECORD 2] ---- + ------------------------------
