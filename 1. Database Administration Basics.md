#POSTGRESQL 


We will do our practice on Vagrant. Vagrant is:

> #Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. 
> #With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, 
increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

It is compatible with VirtualBox.


## Installing / Getting started


1. Go to (https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) and select to rpm section

1. Give the command at the right side. **yum install https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/yum/11/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos11-11-2.noarch.rpm**

1. After download is finished.

```shell
yum install postgresql

yum install postgresql11-server

/ usr / pgsql-11 / bin / postgresql-11-setup initdb
systemctl enable postgresql-11
systemctl start postgresql-11
```

3. / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / data

cd / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / data
-rw -------. 1 postgres postgres 88 Feb 9 15:09 postgresql.auto.conf
-rw -------. 1 postgres postgres 23788 Feb 9 15:09 postgresql.conf
-rw -------. 1 postgres postgres 4269 Feb 9 15:09 pg_hba.conf


4. Login to vt with psql command

\? Enables database objects to be listed with.


5. Helpful site for how Postgre works: interdb.jp/pq


Data base files, where data is

/ Var / lib / pgsql / 11 / data / base


6. Change password on VT

postgres = # \ password
Enter new password:
Enter it again:

7. Database Firewall SETUP also connection setup type

 vi pg_hba.conf
 
 
# TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local all all md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host all all :: 1/128 md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
local replication all md5
host replication all 127.0.0.1/32 ident
host replication all :: 1/128 ident


6. Change the IP address that Vt will listen to
 postgresql.conf
 
We have made listen_addresses * below.

# - Connection Settings -

listen_addresses = '*' # what IP address (es) to listen on;
                                        # comma-separated list of addresses;
                                        # defaults to 'localhost'; use '*' for all

7. After the above operation, the sis with the root user
systemctl restart postgresql-11


8. See the user's password from VT

postgres = # select * from pg_shadow;
 usename | usesysid | usecreatedb | usesuper | userepl | usebypassrls |
       passwd | valuntil | useconfig
+ ------------- + ---------- + ---------- + ---------- --- ------ + -------------- + --------
----------------------------- --------- + ---------- + -
 postgres | 10 | t | t | t | t | md53175
bce1d3201d16594cebf9d7eb3f9d | |
(1 row)




The listener is reloaded with the following via VT.

select pg_reload_conf ();

9. \ dn lists the schemes ..
postgres = # create schema experiment;
CREATE SCHEMA
postgres = # \ dn
  List of schemas
  Name | Owner
-------- + ----------
 trial | postgreS
 public | postgreS
(2 rows)

postgres = # set search_path to try;

The definition of defaul search_pat is in postgresql.conf file.
grep search_path postgresql.conf

If we do not define SEARCH PATH, the related table function cannot be indexed.

postgres = # show search_path;
 search_path
-------------
 trial
(1 row)


show all;
postgres = # show all;

 allow_system_table_mods | off

 archive_command | (Disabled)
 | Sets the shell command that will be called to archive a WAL file.
 archive_mode | off

.
 autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age | 400000000

 autovacuum_naptime | 1m
 | Time to sleep between autovacuum runs.

11. Creating a role on VT
postgres = # create role ali;
CREATE ROLE
postgres = # alter role ali with login;
ALTER ROLE

ROl and User are basically the same thing. It is not authorized to login with the role. But the user has login authority by default.

12. Extensions on VT


postgres = # \ dx
                 List of installed extensions
  Name | Version | Schema | Description
----------------- --------- + --------- + ------------ + -------------
 plpgsql | 1.0 | pg_catalog | PL / pgSQL procedural language
 
 
 
 create extension pg_stat_statemnts;

13. REDOLOG FILES where:

cd / var / lib / pgsql / 11 / data / pg_wal

-bash-4.2 $ ll

Here, we quickly generated data below and these were written to the transaction log file, and our transaction log file, which is one above, increased to 4 after the data.

postgres = # insert into number select generate_series (1,1000000);
INSERT 0 1000000

14. CAP consistencyi availability, a theorem about consistency


15. When replication is done, all binary files and datafiler are used the first time the replication is done. This is the first time the transfer is complete.
However, if the configuration files are modified on the OS side after the replication is completed, this does not go to the replicated location.

In order for the change made to go to the replicated side, it should be given as alter system with SQL commands.


16.
\ h
means help
alter \ h
Shows all commands related to.
\D
Means Describe


17. SQL Tuning, looking at the plans of their queries
There are sites on Google that will post it visually by saying Postgre explain plan

postgres = # explain select count (*) from number;
                                       QUERY PLAN

-------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
---------

         Workers Planned: 2
         -> Partial Aggregate (cost = 57799.00..57799.01 rows = 1 width = 8)
               -> Parallel Seq Scan on number (cost = 0.00..51549.00 rows = 2500000
width = 0)
(5 rows)

postgres = # explain (analyze) select count (*) from number;
                                                                QUERY PLAN
